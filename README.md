The Flight computer for Projecct SPALM

This repository contains the functional and test code for the flight computer of a self-landing model rocket. The flight computer is responsible for controlling the various stages of the rocket's flight, including ignition, thrust control, navigation, and landing.

#Functionality
The flight computer code is designed to achieve the following key functionalities:

Ignition and Thrust Control: The flight computer initiates the rocket's ignition sequence and monitors the thrust control system for optimal performance during the ascent phase.

Navigation and Guidance: The flight computer utilizes sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to determine the rocket's position, velocity, and orientation. It implements navigation algorithms to guide the rocket towards the intended landing zone.

Legs Deployment: Based on altitude, velocity, and other factors, the flight computer triggers the deployment of parachutes to ensure a safe descent and landing.


#Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

src/: This directory contains the source code for the flight computer functionality. It includes modules and scripts responsible for ignition, thrust control, navigation, parachute deployment, and landing control.

tests/: Here, you can find the test code for each functional module. The tests ensure the correctness and reliability of the flight computer's behavior in different scenarios.

docs/: This directory holds any documentation related to the flight computer, including system specifications, algorithm explanations, and usage instructions.
